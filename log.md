# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 30, 2017 
**what i did today:** completed 34 challenges in HTML and CSS in free code camp
**Thoughts:** Basically i have some previous knowledge of HTML and CSS but just wanted to start from the beginning
**Plan for tommorrow:** Will try to complete the HTML basic part quickly and collect info about what i don't know 

### Day 5: January 3, 2018
**what i did today:** completed the bootstrap challenges and started using jquery. Learn a few things about animate.css
**Plan for tommorrow:** Will try to complete the JQuery part and start projects. Also i haven't been consistent with the github logs. So hopefully will log everyday from now on                      

### Day 6: January 4, 2018
**what i did today:** competed jQuery challenges and proceeded to make first project of front-end development
**Plan for tommorrow:** Will try to finish the tribute page also add as many features as i can to it
**Thoughts:** I was finding it somewhat hard to get things where they need to be but didn't stop until i got it done as i wanted it to be...but it is worth it
