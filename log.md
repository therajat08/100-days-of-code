**Plan for tommorrow:** Will try to complete the HTML basic part quickly and collect info about what i don't know 

### Day 5: January 3, 2018
**what i did today:** completed the bootstrap challenges and started using jquery. Learn a few things about animate.css
**Plan for tommorrow:** Will try to complete the JQuery part and start projects. Also i haven't been consistent with the github logs. So hopefully will log everyday from now on
